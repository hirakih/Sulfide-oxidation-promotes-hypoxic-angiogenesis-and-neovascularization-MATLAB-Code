This code is used to quantify the number of nuclei in a user-draw rectangular region of interest (ROI). The code asks the user to input a predetermined number of nuclei images as 3D z-stacks and then ask the user to threshold the first, middle, and last z-slices of the z-stack. Intermediate z-slices will be linearly thresholded. The user will then be asked to draw a rectangular ROI over the area for the code to indentify nuclei. Nuclei that meet size thresholds will be quantified and displayed.
